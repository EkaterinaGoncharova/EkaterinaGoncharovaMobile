1. "Add support of appPackage and appActivity parameters for Android devices
(reading from a .properties file and then setting in the DesiredCapabilities).
Locally installed Appium DT has no need in these parameters, but for Appium
server of Minsk Mobile Farm itâ€™s mandatory.
a. Or try to use autoLaunch capability with app as before. Does this approach work?"

```
appPackage=com.example.android.contactmanager
appActivity=com.example.android.contactmanager.ContactManager
...
capabilities.setCapability(AndroidMobileCapabilityType.APP_PACKAGE, APP_PACKAGE);
capabilities.setCapability(AndroidMobileCapabilityType.APP_ACTIVITY, APP_ACTIVITY);
```
APP capability doesn't work. Application has to be installed before test manually
or via Farm API.

2. "Change settings to run web test on a certain iOS device on Mobile Test Farm.
Run test with your changes. Did test pass?"

```
udid=25ad632db73b1de523be6565f395cae349b4dd13
...
capabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.UDID, UDID);
```
Test passed succesfully.
